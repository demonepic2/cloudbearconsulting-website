## PROBLEM SECTION

**HEADLINE:**
You're Paying for Tools You Don't Use

**BODY:**
Most small businesses waste money on Microsoft 365.

They pay every month. But they only use email and maybe Word.

The rest sits there. Unused. Collecting dust.

Meanwhile, your team:
- Wastes time searching for files
- Sends too many emails back and forth
- Works harder than they need to
- Stays open to hackers and scams

Sound familiar?

It doesn't have to be this way.
